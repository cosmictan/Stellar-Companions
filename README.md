**Checklists** 
- Characterize the stellar variability and rotation periods of single stars and multiple stars and comparing their properties
- Characterize the similarities and differences of the stellar variability and rotation periods in single and multiple star systems with and without known planetary systems
- Compare the properties of planets in single-star systems to those in multiple star systems with an aim to understanding the role of stellar variability in the formation and evolution of these planets
